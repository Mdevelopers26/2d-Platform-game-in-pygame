As mankind’s exploration of the space reaches new heights in the distant future, 
fuelled by the intangible desire to explore and challenge the boundaries of what is possible.

This soon turns into a fight for survival, as the sole surviving human discovers... 
he is not the only living creature on this planet...

Instructions:

Crash Landed is a 2-dimensional platform/swarm defense game, The player is an astronaut who is able to move left, right and jump with
A,D and W respectively and must fight an endless swarm of hostile alien spaceships.
 
The player possesses the ability shoot at enemies with a gun, by default a shot can be fired every 0.4 seconds.
The Player can utilise the gun by moving the mouse to aim and pressing the left mouse button to fire the laser. 
If the laser hits the Aliens(spaceship) the Alien dies and player’s score count goes up.

Randomly, some spaceships (5%) will drop a shield on their death location. This can be picked up and will absorb one
hit from an enemy and also kill whatever hit the player. Player's can hold 2 shields at once, picking up additional after this increases the player's
score and they despawn from the map after 10 seconds if not collected.

The alien's spawn in waves and are programmed to follow the player around and swarm them.
If the alien collides with the (shieldless) player the player dies and the game will finish, displaying the player's final wave and score.
After defeating all the enemies, a new wave will spawn with increased difficulty (more enemies) this repeats until the player eventually is overrun.
The game also has an adjustable difficulty which changes the maximum speed of the aliens, the fire rate of the player weapon, number of
additional enemies per wave and the amount of score recieved for killing enemies/passing a wave. When enemies spawn in, they are assigned a random 
speed between 1 and either 1,2 or 3 depending on the selected difficulty. The enemies are also designed to spawn above the map limit and descend
onto the player.

The game features a menu system which allows the player to start a new game, read the controls, change the default difficulty and exit the game.

The player must navigate ledges to traverse the map, while aliens are able to pass through them.

The game features a graphical component with animation, as well as sound effects and music.

The objective is to get the highest score you can and survive as long as possible!
